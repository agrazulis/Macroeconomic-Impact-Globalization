# Macroeconomic-Impact-Globalization

# General Overview
This repository contrains a problem set for a class on the macroeconomic impact of globalization. I use Python to solve two empricial and two theoretical questions. All answers and code can be found in 'Homework #2 Answers.pdf' and all questions can be found in 'Homework #2 Questions.pdf'.

# Use Case
This problem set is helpful for those trying to analyze the impact of changes in exchange rates on inflation as well as the degree to which exchange rate movements are transmitted to domestic prices. 

# Important Notes
In the "Homework #2 Answers.pdf" you will see the code used for answering each question in the "Input" section. The "Output" section contains the output of running each script shown in the aforementioned "Input" section, and is also the answer to each question in the problem set. If you'd like to replicate this problem set on your own, you can use the data file provided (i.e., "HW2 Price Data.xlsx").
